## Description
#### Here's a Python Project that I made myself simulating a Bank System using Python 3.10.
#### The project gives to you the possibility to create accounts, make deposits, withdraws, transferences and list all existing accounts registered.
#### In addition, account registration relies on CPF validation, whether e-mail exists, and date of birth with verification that the user must be over 18 to create an account.
